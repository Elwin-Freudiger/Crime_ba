# Introduction

We chose to discuss the Criminality in France because as French people
this is a subject that really concerns us. France is one of the top ten
most powerful countries in the world, but we are forced to observe that
as the rest of the world, France is facing very difficult times in terms
of security. This finding has a huge impact on the political discussions
and the polarity that installs itself in the everydays discussion. In
fact, security has become one of the most important political positions
for the actors of the government, and this only in the last thirty
years.

The reason is simple: the amount of attacks, stealing, rapes and many
other types of crimes is exploding in France. Some department like «
Seine Saint Denis » have become unbearable in terms of security, and are
clearly out of control. Different types of trafficking and crimes are
literally freely made. Same finding for the cities of Marseille or
Manosque and many more. But what are the reasons?

As we two are French people we wanted to synthesized the main reasons
presented by the medias of our country for the criminality in France
except for the « Etnical Origin » of the criminals which is forbidden in
France, and measure their real impact on crime rate of the different
territories. In fact the country is facing huge socio-economics,
employment, poverty, conditions of leaving, and school level issues. Our
project wants to explore the link between socio-economic factors and
criminality rates. Establishing a link would give a new look on crime
and its causes. Additionally we are interested in a valuations whether
this data could be used by the government to address public safety.
Moreover, what are the core human drivers that push humans to commit
crimes? How their socio economic environment and their scholar
curriculum impact their ability to commit crimes?

### 1.3 Research questions

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of different
socioeconomic factors on criminality in France. We are using for that an
important gouvernemental database which divide crimes in 14 categories:
Destruction and intentional damages Thefts without violence against
people Residential burglaries Volontariat assault and battery Thefts
from vehicles Domestic assault and battery Theft of vehicle accessories
Other intentional assault and battery Sexual violence Violent robberies
without weapons Drug trafficking Robbery with weapons We will consider
the following macroeconomic variables: Poverty rate, Unemployment rate,
Results at school (Brevet des collèges), Density of Population and
results of previous presidential elections. These are the following
question we'll try to focus on: Can we explain the criminality rate in
France using the unemployment rate? Can we explain the criminality rate
in France using the average earning rate/poverty rate? Can we explain
the criminality rate in France using the school curriculum ? Can the
density of population in territories explain criminality? Can the
immigration rate explain criminality? Can the previous presidential
results in territories have an impact on criminality? Is there a
correlation between these mentioned variables (unemployment rate,
average earning rate)?
